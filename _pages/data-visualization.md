# Student Debt - Is it a Crisis?

As phrased by former Presidential Democrat candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, rising student debt is a big problem in the U.S. Higher education is becoming more expensive - but one might doubt, is it really _that_ alarming? Are returns to education decreasing? Does student debt take a larger portion of total debt?

To understand more about student debt crisis, I used _Survey of Consumer Finances_ (the survey is conducted every three years from 1989, the most recent year is 2016).
